        <div style="width :800px ; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"> Welcome to the internet! A complex, mysterious place that confuses a lot of people. I too used to be perplexed by the internet. I just couldn’t wrap my head around how it worked. Luckily, I was able to take Professor Pablo’s class: CSC 102 “How the Internet Works!” I now how a better understanding of how the internet is layered and how those layers work together. My goal with this website is to teach readers my newly found knowledge so that they too feel more confident in their comprehension of internet (more specifically the four layers of the OSI model). Feel free to read the sections in order or to jump around. Please scroll to the bottom of the page to find the site’s directory so that you learn more about my teammates and their explanations of the internet! </div>

        <div style="width :800px ; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;">The Data-link layer is the layer that deals with physical connections (wired or wireless) between the internet and protocols. This layer is essential because it oversees connecting our devices together. To get information across from device to device they must somehow be connected to each other in this layer. To put this in a simpler way we could think about a group of friends sitting together at a table in a coffee shop. Let’s also say that one of the friends asks for a packet of sugar for their cup of coffee. Since they are all at the same table, we can say that they are “connected”. The passing of sugar around the table can now begin since they are all connected (this connection illustrates an example of the data-link layer). </div>

        <div style="width :800px ; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;">The Network layer is the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection model and oversees transferring packets of data between different devices. This layer is extremely important because it’s responsible for sending data packets back and forth between devices and networks. Continuing with my sugar analogy we could say that this layer could be represented by the scenario where one friend (who would be portraying our router) decides to give a packet of sugar to the friend that requested it. By giving them the sugar, they are representing the physical transportation of the item or (data). It doesn’t matter how the person gives the sugar to their friend, the only thing that matters is that the sugar gets to their friend.</div>

        <div style="width :800px ; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;">The Transport layer decides how information is transferred between two nodes (or devices). It has the important job of breaking up information and sending the packet segments to where they need to go. Since this layer has a greater responsibility than the previous it also has a better understanding of the data its sending in its entirety. This allows its to not send all the data at once, which helps avoid congestion on the route it is sending the information through. Imagine that the friend who asked for sugar now has two cups of coffee, the person giving them the sugar would like to know which cup they need the sugar for before they hand it to them. After labeling the cups with A and B (port addresses) the person sending the sugar over can determine that a specific amount needs to be given to their friend so that they can put it in cup A.</div>

        <div style="width :800px ; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;">The Application layer is the layer that we can interact with. On this layer we can alter information that is being sent. As written in the name, this layer also consists of applications that are installed on our device operating systems. These applications help make our interfaces more user friendly by creating a simpler route of communication for its users (us). A better way to explain this layer using my sugar analogy would be this scenario: Imagine that after the friend receives the sugar packets and puts it in their coffees, they taste them. If the friend determines that one coffee is too sweet then they can discard of it, get a new cup of coffee and ask their friend for more sugar but in a lesser amount. In this scenario the friend is directly involved with process of mixing the sugar and tasting the coffee which is like the interface user interactions on the application layer.</div>
