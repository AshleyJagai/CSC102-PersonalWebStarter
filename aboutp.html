        <div style="width :500px ; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"> Hiya! My name is Priscilla Trejo, and I am a first-year student at Smith College. Ever since I was a child, I was fascinated by science. I always knew that one day I would want to be a computer scientist. Some of my favorite movies growing up were The Ghostbusters, The Terminator, and The Matrix. Obviously, you can see that I’m a bit obsessed with Science Fiction. During High school I decided to join my school's robotics team as the lead programmer and team coach. While in this club, I learned the fundamentals of Java and how to be a better problem solver. As a team we were able to engineer and program a competition grade robot that could run using an autonomous and TeleOp program. We ended up winning First place in our district competition, third place in our regional competition and even made it to compete in the FIRST Robotics International competition. I am so thankful I had the opportunity to participate in those competitions because it was there where I was able to meet like minded students and professionals in the STEM field. Due to my participation in the FIRST Robotics International Competition, I ended up being recruited as a Global sustainment student intern for Lockheed Martin. This internship allowed me to learn more about the various softwares used for LM’s F-35 fighter jet program and helped me get my foot in the door for my future career. During the period of my internship, I was also able to jump start a raspi B+ based project where my team and I’s goal was to reduce the percentage of human trafficking victims in the DFW area. Although this project is still under development, we hope to one day implement our system around the DFW area for our testing phase. I am fascinated by the endless possibilities that knowing computer science provides so during my time at Smith College I plan to continue taking Computer Science related courses and get my bachelor’s degree in CS. My main objective is to one day, use the skills that I'm developing now to help others.
