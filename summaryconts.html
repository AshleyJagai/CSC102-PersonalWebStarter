            word-break: break-word;" The link layer is the first stop! The link
            layer essentially connects your computer to the rest of the web by
            having it say, “hello!! Is there anyone out there?”. Essentially,
            every computer has something called a MAC (Media Access Control)
            address. It is built into the computer and is unique to that
            computer. So, when you want to connect to the internet, your
            computer will connect to a wifi network. When connecting to the
            network, it wants to find it’s “gateway”. The gateway is the first
            router to accept packets, or data, from your computer so it may be
            sent out to further routers or computers. To find the gateway, your
            computer sends out a radio message into the entire network asking…
            well... “Who here is the gateway?”. Then the gateway will send back
            its own MAC address. Then, your computer can start sending data that
            way. However, there’s a problem with this system. When your computer
            sends out these radio signals, every computer will receive these
            messages. Now imagine all these computers constantly sending and
            receiving all of these messages at the same time! The internet can
            do a lot of complex things very quickly, but this… this might be too
            much. So, there’s a couple protocols to offset this! The first part
            is called carrier sense. Basically, all this means is that your
            computer will wait to see if they can get a signal from the gateway
            before they actually send their message out. If there is no
            transmittance, then your computer will start sending data. If more
            than one wifi radio transmits at the same time, the computers are
            smart and will both stop sending data. Then, they both compute
            different amounts of time to wait so that they don’t both start
            sending data at the same time. This process of listening, waiting,
            sending etc is called “Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
            Detection”. In addition to the CSMA/CD, the other way to combat this
            problem is the token approach. Essentially, computers on the network
            will pass around a “token” which tells the computer that they can
            start sending data. Once the computer finishes, it will send the
            token off to another computer and all the computers just wait to
            take their turn. Overall, the link layer helps move data from your
            computer to the first destination in the data’s journey. Note that
            all of this only occurs with the help of the physical layer! The
            physical layer uses physical connections through wires (like fiber
            optic cables) to send raw data in the form of bits (zeros and ones).
            Then the data link layer takes this data and makes it into a packet
            (organized groups of bits) to be sent out across nodes (hops). To
            understand the link layer a bit more, imagine you want to schedule a
            doctor’s appointment with a specialist at your doctor’s office. You
            ring up the general office phone, and a recorded message starts
            reading out all of the extensions to each of the doctors. You
            wouldn’t just start yelling, “HELLO? HELLO? REPRESENTATIVE. I WANT
            TO SPEAK WITH DR. SMITH”. I mean, you could, but it would just tie
            the phone line up as there are only so many receptionists. Instead,
            you could be like sending computer, and wait to hear the contact
            information you need (the gateway’s MAC address). Then you can dial
            the correct number and talk with your doctor (send the packet to the
            gateway).

            The IP layer comes after the link layer. This layer deals with
            getting your message from the gateway all the way to your
            destination computer. In order to do this, your data must make
            little hops from computer to computer until it reaches its
            destination. So, how does this happen? First, each computer
            connected to the internet is assigned an IP address. This is
            basically a destination address for a computer to send out so that
            data may be received by it. Each IP address is assigned based on the
            location the computer is when it’s connecting to the internet. So,
            your IP address in your public library will probably be different
            than the one you have in your house. This idea of constantly
            borrowing and giving up unique IP addresses is called the DHCP
            (dynamic host configuration protocol). There are two versions of IP
            addresses. There is IPv4 and IPv6. The addresses are just a series
            of numbers between 0-255. The reason why there are two different
            versions is because we were running out of unique combinations for
            IPv4 IPs so we created the longer IPv6 which would allow for more
            combinations of numbers. However, there is still a shortage of
            unique IPs. Thus there’s a new system called NAT (network address
            translation). NAT assigns your computer with a non-routable address
            when sending data out, but quickly replaces it with its own unique
            IP. Thus, instead of adding another routable IP address to the
            journey, the gateway just uses its own and can still get packets
            sent back to you. A typical IP address is broken into 2 parts: the
            network number and the host identifier. A network number helps to
            make addresses more identifiable. For example, all the computers
            being used at Smith probably have the same network number and thus
            when an IP address is being looked up, you can identify its general
            location. While this may seem confusing, it just makes it so that
            routers are not overloaded with information. Each time a packet is
            sent to another router, that new router does not have to know
            exactly where the packet is going, it just has to know how to send
            it in the right direction. The specificity of location only starts
            to become important as the packet gets really close to its
            destination. In terms of how each router decides the best route to
            send the packet, it really just learns from the other routers around
            it and always sends the packet on what it knows to be the most
            efficient route possible. Even when a router along the journey is no
            longer working, the previous router can detect this and will send it
            on an alternative route. In addition to IP assignments, the IP
            protocol also prevents packets from being caught in a never ending
            loop. Suppose you have a packet that keeps getting rerouted in
            between 3 routers who all think they are sending it on the most
            efficient route. Well, the packet would just keep bouncing between
            them forever! To combat this, there is a feature called TTL (time to
            live), in which each packet that is sent out only has a certain
            number of “hops” it may take before it is destroyed and a message is
            sent back to the source computer to tell it what happened. Overall,
            the IP layer is designed to get your data from your computer across
            a large distance to its destination. To understand it more clearly,
            imagine that you’re trying to send a package to your friend. Think
            of the postal system as the IP protocol. When you send a package,
            the mailman doesn’t just pick it up and travel directly to your
            friend’s house. Instead, he mails it to the closest mailing center
            in that direction. And then that mailing center ships it to the next
            mailing center in that direction and on and on and on until it gets
            to your friend’s post office and his mailman delivers it straight to
            his door. The IP system is the same. Packets are sent in the general
            direction until eventually, it’s close enough that routers will
            consider its specific address and deliver it.

            While not a part of the layered model of the internet, the DNS is a
            very important piece of the user interaction and the capitalization
            of the internet. The domain name system makes it so that you don’t
            have to type in or remember an entire IP address when you’re trying
            to reach a website! Instead, you can give your computer a name like
            www.facebook.com and it will look up the IP address for you! Unlike
            IPs, a domain name is given out based on ownership of that name. An
            organization called ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned
            Names and Numbers) will assign top level domains (TLD) such as .com,
            .org, .edu to organizations to be managed. ICANN also assigns
            country codes like .uk, .za, or .us. These are called country-code
            top level domains (ccTLD). Then, once an organization owns that
            domain, they can add subdomains within it (for example,
            kotisdesign.com also contains the subdomain stores.kotis
            design.com). As for reading domain names, unlike IPs where we read
            left to right, domain names are read right to left (where the right
            most part is the most general and the most specific part is to the
            left). The DNS is kind of like trying to remind your friend of an
            acquaintance. You could say, “Oh, his social security number is
            000-123-456”, but your friend wouldn’t know that! (much like you
            wouldn’t know an IP address). So instead you can say, “Oh, do you
            know my buddy Johnny Appleseed? With the brown hair and blue eyes?
            He’s in our English class”. Then, your friend would probably
            recognize him. Giving his more well known name is like giving the
            domain name and then adding those physical attributes is like the
            subdomains of a website that make it different from the main domain.

            Next, we have the transport layer! Remember how we talked about data
            being sent over hops? Well sometimes things get lost in translation
            or messed up. In order to keep things running smoothly, we have the
            transport layer which makes sure that things get to the right place!
            Basically, the transport layer adds little pieces of information to
            packets so that when they reach each hop in the destination, they
            have little tags telling them how things should be reassembled or
            transmitted. When you first send out a packet, along with all the
            data, it also has a little header! The header contains three parts:
            a link header, IP header, and a TCP (transmission control protocol)
            header. While the TCP and IP header remain the same throughout the
            journey, each time the packet reaches a new destination, a new link
            header replaces the old one. Then there’s the IP header which has
            the IP address and TTL (time to live). And finally, the TCP header
            explains where the data in the packet should be located (recall that
            a packet’s data is split up as it is sent across and is later
            reassembled). Now, what happens when the data finally reaches its
            destination? The receiving computer will put things in order as
            pieces of the packet come in. In order to prevent networks from
            getting backed up or from the receiving computer getting too
            overwhelmed, the sending computer will only send through a certain
            amount of data at a time. This is called the window size, and if the
            receiving computer is quick at acknowledging the sent data, the
            sending computer will slowly increase the window size, stopping when
            acknowledgements slow down. If a packet is lost, the receiving
            computer will realize too much time has passed and tell the sending
            computer where it left off. Then, the sending computer will back up
            (as it stores all the data in the packet until all data has been
            acknowledged) and start sending from the position where the packet
            was lost. These two systems keep networks running smoothly! The
            reason why this is so important is because the transport layer
            ensures the server/client relationship between a network application
            and a local computer runs correctly. A client is the application
            that initiates the connection on the local computer and the server
            is the application that responds to the connection request. However,
            servers often have many applications running at once. In order for
            your web application to choose the correct service they want from
            the host, we need to use something called ports. Each port is
            connected to the main IP, but it also has its own number (i.e. HTTP
            is 80, TELNET is 23, etc). So, when a client application wants to
            interact with a server application, it knows exactly where to go.
            The system of ports is kind of like a friend telling you they want
            you to get them something from a superstore, like Walmart. They
            wouldn’t just say “Hey go get me something from Walmart”. They’d
            probably say “I’m hungry, can you please go to the produce section
            and get stuff to make dinner”. It’s the same thing with ports. The
            client application knows the general address it’s going to (the IP),
            but it also needs to know what specific piece of the server
            application it’s going to interact with (thus a port number is
            needed). Again, this system prevents confusion and ensures that
            packets are sent in an efficient manner. The TTL, window size, and
            reassembly can be thought of as buying a bunch of furniture from
            IKEA. Like the window size method, IKEA wouldn’t just send you an
            entire living set of furniture in a single box in a single shipment.
            That would be ridiculously inefficient and very costly. Instead they
            send separate packages in a way that ships all of the furniture in a
            fast and effective way. Now the TTL would be like you not receiving
            one of the desks you ordered. Like the sending computer, IKEA would
            send you an email saying, “Hey, we saw there was a problem with your
            shipping. It’s taking longer than expected”. And then you would tell
            them what items you were missing and they’d send them to you (the
            receiving computer). And finally, the reassembly is quite
            explanatory, you receive the furniture pieces (data) and then put it
            together (the packet) based on the instructions (the header). And
            voila! You have yourself a new living room set AND a fully
            transported packet of data!

            Finally, we have the application layer! Recall the importance of the
            client/server relationship when looking at these upper layers of the
            internet. When you want to go to a website (for example, this one!)
            your computer will look up the corr. IP address and then makes a
            transport connection. Then, it asks for data from the server and
            when the data is received, your browser will present it to you on
            the screen. The protocol to make this happen between the web client
            and server is called the HyperText Transport Protocol, or as you’ve
            probably seen it, HTTP. So after the transport connection is made,
            the most common HTTP protocol called GET is often executed. GET
            essentially tells the server which specific page it’s looking to
            display on the browser for the user. Then the server will respond
            with something called a status code, which usually says something
            like “Hey! I have your page” or “404 Page not found”. Then your
            browser receives the page in the form of an HTML document. This is
            made from HTML, a type of markup code that positions things like
            text and images on the page along with other code from markup
            languages like CSS and Javascript. The browser then interprets this
            code and presents the final formatted page to you on the screen!
            While GET is very useful, there are many other HTTP protocols. In
            fact, the process of sending an email has a completely different
            HTTP protocol! Basically, because your computer may not be on all
            the time, the data for your mail is actually sent to a server, not
            your computer first. That way when you turn on your computer, all
            the mail on that server (which you can think of as a mailbox), is
            then sent to your computer. This protocol is more complicated than
            the GET protocol and is called the IMAP (Internet Message Access
            Protocol). Overall, the application layer works upon the foundation
            set by the systems of the transport layer to display the desired web
            pages from a website or email in an effective manner. We can also
            think of the application layer like designing a room. Imagine you
            order a bunch of furniture from IKEA- again (this is the data of a
            webpage). You get it delivered to your house (using the
            internetworking protocol), and then put all the pieces together
            (like repackaging in the transport layer). Now that you have all
            these pieces of furniture put together, you can look at the layout
            you drew (HTML and other markup languages), and set up the room for
            the final look of how you want it to be (the web page being
            displayed).
