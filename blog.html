      <br />
      Today I learned how to use basic CSS! Personally I find it a little bit
      harder than HTML, but I still think it was interesting to learn! I can't
      wait to finish making my website! Today- I also signed up for my first
      hackathon! I did it through Major League Hacks (MHL) and I created a team
      with some girls from Kode With Klossy (KWK). I'll have to keep you guys
      updated!
      <br />
      until next time,
      <br />
