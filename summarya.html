        <p href="#intro">
          Welcome; I am assuming the reason you are here is to learn about the
          Open System Interconnection (OSI). Let's start with what even is it.
          It is a model used to make sense of the network design model. Although
          you may think that we already have a model for that use, the TCP/IP
          and the OSI model are entirely different. The TCP/IP model is like a
          blueprint for anyone who wants to build a model. While the OSI model
          is how the network .. well works!. We will be talking about four
          different layers: the Datalink layer, the network layer, the transport
          layer, and the application layer. Below you will find more information
          on each layer and what they do.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h2
          href="https://csc-102-project.glitch.me/summarya.html#:~:text=what%20they%20do.-,Data%20Link%20Layer,-The%20data%20link"
        >
          Data Link Layer
        </h2>
        <p>
          The data link layer is the second of seven layers in the OSI model of
          computer networking. The data link layer serves as the foundation for
          communication across various physical media (the connection between
          three or more computers). This layer transports data between Ethernet
          devices and connects the layers above it to the layers below it (the
          physical layer). The data link layer provides the functional and
          procedural means for data transfer between network entities and the
          ability to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the
          physical layer. Frame collisions can also occur when multiple devices
          attempt to use the same medium simultaneously. Data-link protocols
          define how devices detect and recover from collisions, as well as
          mechanisms to reduce or prevent them. In this sense, the data link
          layer can be seen as the traffic cop; it attempts to act as a mediator
          between parties vying for access to a medium without regard for their
          ultimate destination. The data link layer frames the data it receives
          and sends it out over the network. For example, in the image below,
          computer one connects to one network while computer two connects to
          another. To connect these networks, the data network layer uses IP
          packets to convert them into framesâ€”imagine the data link layer
          playing telephone with its top and bottom layers.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h2>Network Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The transport layer sends data segments to the network layer. Its
          function is to send received data segments from one computer to
          another that are connected in different networks. This layer's
          functions include logical addressing, path determination, and routing.
          Because each computer has a unique IP address, the network layer sends
          all IP data to each segment in the form of IP packets. IP addresses
          are assigned to ensure that each has arrived at its destination. It
          specifies how routers forward packets across multiple hops from their
          origin to their destination. Routing is the process of moving data
          packets from one location to another. Consider the network layer to be
          a vehicle that transports you from one location to another. Path
          determination is the process of determining the best possible path for
          a data packet to take in order to get to its destination. This is
          similar to the route that the GPS gives the car to get to their
          destination because the GPS tends to choose the best possible route.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h2>Transport Layer</h2>
        <p>
          Through segmentation, flow control, and error control, this layer
          ensures the reliability of communication. Data for segmentation is
          received from the session layer. Each data set is divided into
          segments, each of which contains a sequence number and a port
          destination number. Port numbers are generated by the application from
          which the data is being sent. Consider this your home address. And the
          sequence number is a series of numbers that combine to form the
          correct message that was sent. This layer in flow control regulates
          the amount of data sent. If the amount of data sent exceeds what can
          be processed, the transport layer slows the amount of data sent by the
          server so that the data can be received by the receiving device.
          Similarly, if the data being sent is too slow, the transport layer
          will speed it up. Error control is used when data does not arrive at
          its intended destination. The Transport layer handles this by
          automatically sending a Repeat Request, which resends the lost data.
          Similarly, it employs a system known as checks, which determines
          whether the data received is the data that was intended to be
          received.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h2>Application Layer</h2>
        <p>
          This layer should be self-explanatory. The application layer is a
          network application that connects to the internet, such as Google
          Chrome or Skype. Web browsers are network applications that run on
          your computer, so they do not reside in the application layer, but
          they do use some protocols from the application layer, such as HTTP,
          HTTPS, etc. All network applications rely on the Application layer,
          and many of them use the protocols in the Application layer to
          transfer files, surf the web, and so on.
